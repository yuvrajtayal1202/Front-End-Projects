# 🌐 Front-End Projects

Welcome to my collection of front-end projects built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
These projects reflect my hands-on journey in mastering web development fundamentals.

This repository is part of my personal roadmap to a ₹1 Cr package, and I'm currently in the early stages — focused on building real-world mini apps and strengthening my front-end foundation.
